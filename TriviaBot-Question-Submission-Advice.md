<H1>How to submit good questions to TriviaBot</H1>

**TLDR: No low quality questions**

_We will not accept any questions which clearly have a small amount of time or research put into them (a.k.a. `spam questions`) or are hard for moderators to verify. Here are some examples of low quality questions that will get denied and possibly a submission ban for the submitter._

`what is 1 + 1`:
This question is low quality because it incorporates something that almost everyone knows and isn't really trivia. We will deny this question.

`Is <something> <something>?`:
This question is low quality because it is a simple yes/no question that can be answered in under a second by just typing `yes and no` in chat.

`Who is the current president of the USA`:
This question is low quality since it doesn't provide a year and just says `current`. This means that in x years this question will have to be replaced. We will deny this question.

`in the star trek what is the letter GAN's meaning`:
This question is low quality since it breaks grammar rules and has spelling mistakes. If you do not fluently speak English, submit your question in your native language and we will translate it. We probably would deny this question.

`What is the best game`:
This question is low quality since it relies heavily on opinion, not statistics.

`<insert random spam>`:
You'll receive a warning or ban for this.

`What is <my / your friend / someone unknown to most people>'s favorite <something>?`:
You must be well-known to get a question about you added to TriviaBot.

`Who is the best <something> in <your server name>?`:
Not only does this change over time, your server probably isn't well-known if you have time to submit questions like these!

`<random question from some anime / tv show / game / book / etc without context>`:
How would you like it if I asked you `who wear hat` and you had to answer in 30 seconds? Now if the question was something like: `Who is obsessed with hats in Alice in Wonderland?`, the question would be accepted.

`A: <super long quote>`:
Please limit answers to 1 - 4 words or a number.

`99*1234567890`:
Math questions should be limited to interesting, non-conflicting questions. For example, `What is the first 3 digits of the golden ratio?`.

`Are you gay / do you like sprouts / Does <random person> smell of poo?`
Questions should not depend on the person being asked the question. Questions should definitely **NOT** intentionally insult, bully or abuse others.

`What was <random YouTuber with less than 1K subs>' first/last/original video/post/channel name/creation date/etc?`
Tiny YouTubers, twitch streamers with a small following are not notable enough.

_Here are some examples of high quality questions._

`What is the first name of first gaming youtuber to reach 50 million subscribers`:
This question is **high** quality since it specifies what the answer is (first name) and is easily fact check-able.

**Remember, questions are accepted at the moderators discretion!**
